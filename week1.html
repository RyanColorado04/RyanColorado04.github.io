									<h1>Weekly Update</h1>
								</header>
								<p>I got my GitHub pages up. I just added an index page because I'm still learning how it all works but when I got there the index page does work. I found a good tutorial and I'm going to go through it this week while I have downtime at work. Once I have it set up nicely I'll start adding the chapter questions and my thoughts on each chapter on there.</p>

								<p>I read 2 chapters in the book we agreed would work and I'm working through most of the problems. That is most of what I did this week because I lost power most of the week.
								
								<p>I got started on Excercism. I'm embarrassed to admit that I spent over an hour getting the "Hello World" to work. I didn't realize that you just had to remove the string they had and post "Hello World" instead. I was trying to create custom objects and functions in Scala which was a good learning experience but also a complete waste of time in getting to actually start. I'm trying to knock out a few of these tonight now that I have power again.</p>
								
								<p>I'm also researching a project I can do. I want to use functional programming to solve something it is ideal for. There are a lot of good ideas for projects out there but I don't want something too advanced. I'll have that decided upon by the end of this week.</p>
