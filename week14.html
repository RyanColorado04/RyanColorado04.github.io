									<h1>Weekly Update</h1>

								<p>Functional programming (FP) in Scala is an incredibly difficult way to program correctly, but I am glad I have started to learn it this semester. I will continue after this semester and hope to someday be a master. FP is based on the simple premise of constructing programs by only using pure functions. A function is pure if it does not have a side effect. A function has a side effect if it does something other than returning a result. When I think of writing code with this in mind, even if I’m not using Scala, I write much better code that is more efficient and easier to debug and maintain.</p>

								<p>The main thing that I have learned from my independent study this semester is that while functional programming is a restriction on how to write programs, it is not a restriction on what programs can do or express. I also learned first-hand through experience and through my studies how FP also increases modularity, which makes it easier to test, reuse, parallelize, generalize and to reuse code. I have used this in my daily job as a systems administrator to write better code that is easier to test and update.</p>

								<p>Over this semester, I finished a Udemy course (Scala & Functional Programming Essentials by Daniel Ciocîrlan) and a textbook (Functional Programming in Scala First Edition by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason). These were both great resources, but this is a very challenging subject to master. Even with all these respources, I still struggled to solve the Scala Excercism problems in a functional way. This is going to sound silly and trivially true, but you can't write functional programming code if you don't understand functional programming. Unlike other languages like Python, you can't just start hacking away and then get it to work and improve it later. This meant I had to master certain idiosyncrasies of functional programming and Scala to even write functional code.</p>

								<p>The key to me finally starting to understand functional programing was mastering referential transparency. Referential transparency means that an expression in a program may be replaced by its value without changing the result of the program. Referential transparency forces the invariant that everything a function does is represented by the value it returns. This means that methods should always return the same value for a given argument, without having any other effect. By understanding this, many more opportunities in Scala and FP are available to you and you can begin to write functional code.</p>

								<p>For an example from my job, I wrote a huge script in probably the least functional way possible using PowerShell. Microsoft made some changes to PowerShell that broke it, and after a year I needed to pull it out and use it, but it didn’t work anymore. If it was a functionally written program with no side effects, it would have been easier to figure out what had changed. Instead, it took me 2 hours to find the bug because I had to step through the whole program. Designing it in a functional way would have been so much better for maintaining and debugging long term. I rewrote the code in a functional way (as much as PowerShell supports), and it is now much easier to understand, and when I pass it off to someone else to maintain, they will easily be able to see what each step does.</p>

								<p>I really want to continue to learn this way of programming because it just makes a ton of sense. It’s such an intuitive way to think about coding when you really start thinking about it. It's just hard to internalize and then use, so the learning curve is steep. I'm going to continue learning about functional programming after this semester, and it has helped me at work and in my courses. As I mentioned above, while functional programming is a restriction on how to write programs, it is not a restriction on what programs can do or express. This means there are many opportunities to continue learning and for a cool project to demonstrate my skills. I am also going to finish the Excercism problems because I learned a lot doing them and some of them were really challenging. I am excited for the future and I am incredibly glad I chose this topic this semester.</p>
