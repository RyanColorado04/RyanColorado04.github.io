CSPB 3112 - Knox/Stade - Professional Development in Computer Science

The goal of this independent study is to learn more about functional programming languages and to create a project in Scala using what I have learned. They are a fascinating subject with many real world applications. Functional programming languages are used to build and edit software by focusing on pure functions. They differ from object-oriented programming because they focus on functions, while object-oriented programming languages focus on objects. Functional programming languages are efficient and highly logical, making them easy to work with when performing parallel programming.

Functional programming languages are used at many types of software companies, including eCommerce and streaming services such as Netflix and Airbnb. Functional programming languages are increasing in popularity, and developers that work with functional programming languages are among the highest paid in the industry.

To learn functional programming, I will use Scala. I already have a functional programming language book that uses Scala approved by my advisor and have found practice problems online that I will use to supplement my studies. At the end of the semester, I will create a project showcasing what I have learned.
